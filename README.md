# Ackee Android cookbook 

Like our fellow chefs from [iOS team][1] and [Node.js team][2], we make our apps with heart and soul. 

A restaurant client can hardly be happy when he finds different ingredients in the same dish over and over again. A restaurant chef can hardly be happy when each cook prepares the same dish using its own recipe. Quite a mess, isn't it?

Thats why, in [Ackee][2] we emphasize on consistent code style, technologies and best practices to maximize the efficiency and minimize the stress of out team members. We're trying to keep up with the latest trends and constantly improve our skills and knowledge. We don't shun the best of third party products that may improve our code and simplify the development.

This cookbook will serve our internal purposes, as well as sharing our experience with the open community. We hope that somebody may be inspired by it or teach us something new. Besides, we're always hiring, so you can become acquainted with our approach before the interview. ;)
